## 🎯 Motivation

The Event Engagement Dashboard was born out of the need for a more accessible and organised way to track event data for Women in Tech, the student-run university club I’m involved in. During meetings with our industry sponsors, I noticed a recurring challenge—sponsors were keen to understand past event statistics to better plan their future collaborations, yet we struggled to provide concrete answers on the spot since engagement metrics were difficult to retrieve quickly. 

Recognising this gap, I developed a dashboard that would centralise and visualise this data, making it easier for both committee members and sponsors to explore attendance numbers, popular event times, survey feedback sentiment, and engagement trends. By automating data ingestion from Google Sheets, the dashboard eliminates manual tracking efforts while ensuring up-to-date information. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and data-driven tool that helps optimise future event planning and enhance sponsor relationships.

## 🚀 Features

- **Easy navigation:** 
- **Interactive statistics:** 
- **Clean and inspired design:** UI inspiration from Women in Tech colour scheme, the UI provides a clean and enjoyable learning experience.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

Data may not be fully representative due to the limited number of survey responses. Since only a subset of attendees provides feedback, insights may not reflect the broader participant experience. Additionally, response bias can skew results, so trends should be interpreted with these limitations in mind.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This simple UI was built using Streamlit.
